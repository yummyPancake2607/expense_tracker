## 🧠 How It Works

All expenses are stored in a file called `expenses.json`.
Each expense has:

* **id**: A unique identifier for the expense.
* **date**: The date of the expense (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD).
* **description**: A brief description of the expense.
* **amount**: The monetary value of the expense.
* **category**: The category of the expense (e.g., Food, Transport, Utilities).
* **month**: The 2-digit month number when the expense was added.

Budgets are also stored in `expenses.json` and can be set for each month.

## 📌 Requirements

* Python 3.x (No external libraries needed)
